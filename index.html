    <p> <i>Interesting Facts About Chameleon</i> </p>
          <ul>
                <li>
                    A lot of people think chameleons change their colour based on their surroundings – sort of like camouflage. However, this isn’t true.
                    Chameleons actually change their colour due to a number of different factors, including their mood, changes in light or temperature, or the humidity of their environment.              </li>
                <li>
                    Chameleons have eyes in the backs of their heads Well, not literally – but they can move their eyes separately, with each eye having a field of 180 degrees.                  This means they can see 360 degrees if they need to!
                </li>
                <li>
                    Chameleons have extremely powerful tongues Excluding their tail, some chameleons’ tongues can be twice the length of their body.
                     Their tongues consist of both muscles and bones, and can bend round to grab their pray.
